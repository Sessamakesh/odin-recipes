        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
            <li>In an oven safe dish place the two chicken breasts and 2 cups of chicken stock</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and cook for about 30 minutes or until the internal temp is 165</li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks rinse the celery and peel the carrot and onion</li>
            <li>Dice the vegetables into pieces of your preferred size<em>I personally prefer to dice my vegetables very finely so that they cook a little faster and mix better but any size or shape will work</em></li>
            <li>Add your vegetables to a pot with the butter and garlic and sautee until the garlic becomes aromatic </li>
            <li>Once the chicken is done shred or dice and add to vegetables</li>
            <li>Next add the remaining 4 cups of stock and water if necessary to cover the ingredients</li>
            <li>Bring the stock to a boil and add your preferred noodles<em>I like to use egg noodles</em></li>
            <li>Once noodles are cooked to your liking turn the heat down to keep the pot simmering and serve hot</li>
        </ol>
