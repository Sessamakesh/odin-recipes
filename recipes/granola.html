        <p>Granola is a simple snack thats easy to make and delicious for everyone. This recipe is one of my favorites. I actually make it for the restaurant that I currently work at. I could write more about the history of granola but personally I hate long introductions to recipes so lets get in to it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups Oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Walnuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Pecans</li>
            <li>2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Canola Oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees</li>
            <li>Roughly chop walnuts and pecans</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients</li>
            <li>Put some parchment paper down on a sheet tray</li>
            <li>Either form your mixture into bars or just evenly coat the tray</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes</li>
            <p><em>The granola will still be a little soft when it comes out of the oven but will harden as it cools</em></p>
            <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool</li>
            <li>If making bars bag them and store for later. If making loose granola break up the tray into smaller pieces and store</li>
        </ol>
